# Fullstack Boilerplate with React and NestJS

This is my (WIP) personal boilerplate with React and NestJS. Most of the efforts were focused on the backend part, because I'm usually more flexible on my frontend choices.

This boilerplate includes:

- OAuth authentication using GitHub and Google
- DB interface with postgres through TypeORM

More info coming soon.
